Acharya, with less schooling but with greater wisdom, has inspired thousands of people via his books and won their hearts by performing.</p>
            <p>Bansha Hari Acharya was raised in a traditional household where his parents encouraged him to pursue studies in <em>Rudri</em> and <em>Sanskrit</em>. They desired for him to grow up to be a well-known <em>Pandit</em>. He was therefore prohibited from attending school like other regular children.Acharya was a cheeky child who was not at all submissive. His disposition was inherently humorous, and he would amuse his pals by making comical impersonations of their professors. Without Acharya, the friends used to remark, it would be lonely.</p>
